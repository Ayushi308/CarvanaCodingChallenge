# CarvanaCodingChallenge
* Your README should include 


** how to run your program.
Through the terminal first enter javac CodingChallenge.java. Then enter java CodingChallenge [filename]. [filename] refers to the filename or filepath that you would like to be scanned. If you are simply entering filename ensure that file is added into the src folder inside. 


** What you would do next, given more time (if anything)?
Going forward I would look towards working on the extra credits tasks. Specifically, I would love to figure out how to apply special character and unicodes. On the other hand, I would also look towards creating a algorithm with greater efficiency so it can handle larger files and running the application through docker containers. Add flexibility to algorithim so it could handle variances like common phrases of four words or more, changing limit from 100 to 20. 


** Are there bugs that you are aware of? 
Currently my main concern is with the Pattern Matching portion of the application as it is my first time utilizng this java features. And so, as another aspect that I would like to work on moving forward would be to run tests on the applicaiton to ensure that this aspect is functioning correctly with different edge cases. Example edge cases also include what if there is one long consistent word, only three words, and empty text file.
